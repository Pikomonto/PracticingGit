#Blue Ribbon Cheesecake#
**Total Time**: 4 hours  **Kitchen Time**: 20 min

###Ingredients###
- 2 ten ounce packages Cream Cheese (light or regular, I don't notice a difference)
- 2 eggs
- Pie Crust (Chocolate is preferred)
- 3/4 cup Peanut butter (or to taste)
- Small Reese's cups, enough to crumble up (I like 1/2 package)
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar

First, combine sugar, eggs and cream cheese using an electric mixer.  Mix until smooth.

Pour a little of this mixture into the bottom of the pie crust, and set pie crust in freezer.

Add peanut butter to remaining mixture and mix.  You'll notice the mixture is tougher than before.  Add a splash of milk if it gets too tough to work.

Add peanut butter mixture to pie crust and smooth out.

Bake at 325 for 40 minutes.  Refigerate for 3 hours.  Sprinkle crushed Reese's on top.
