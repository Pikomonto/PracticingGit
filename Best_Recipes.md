#Blue Ribbon Cheesecake#
**Total Time**: 4 hours  **Kitchen Time**: 20 min

###Ingredients###
- 2 ten ounce packages Cream Cheese (light or regular, I don't notice a difference)
- 2 eggs
- Pie Crust (Chocolate is preferred)
- 3/4 cup Peanut butter (or to taste)
- Small Reese's cups, enough to crumble up (I like 1/2 package)
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar

First, combine sugar, eggs and cream cheese using an electric mixer.  Mix until smooth.

Pour a little of this mixture into the bottom of the pie crust, and set pie crust in freezer.

Add peanut butter to remaining mixture and mix.  You'll notice the mixture is tougher than before.  Add a splash of milk if it gets too tough to work.

Add peanut butter mixture to pie crust and smooth out.

Bake at 325 for 40 minutes.  Refigerate for 3 hours.  Sprinkle crushed Reese's on top.

#A Bacon Lover's Vegetable Soup#

- 1 lb bacon
- 6 big potatoes
- 16 oz Chicken broth
- 1/2 cup chopped carrots
- 1/2 cup chopped onions
- 1/2 cup chopped celery
- Oregano and sage to taste

Make bacon.  Keep grease in pan afterwards.  Put bacon off to the side

Peel potatoes and microwave them for 2 minutes until soft (do this in shifts of 2 potatoes, while you peel the next 2).  Chop into 1/8ths and put into large pot with chicken broth over medium heat.

Saute vegetables in bacon grease for 5 minutes or so and pour the vegetables and grease into the pot. 

After 20 minutes, pour half of the contents of the pot into a blender and blend until creamy.  Return blender contents to pot and stir.

Top with cheese and chopped up bacon and serve with crackers.
